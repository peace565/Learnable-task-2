# Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull.
git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo. The git pull command does both.

# Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it.
 A Git rebase changes the base of the developer's branch from one commit to another, so it looks like they have created their branch from a different commit.
Command: git rebase <base>

# Explain in simple terms git cherry-pick and the command for it. 
Git cherry-pick is for choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another.  It is mainly used if you donâ€™t want to merge the whole branch and you want some of the commits.
Command: git cherry-pick<commit-hash>
